This is a Trip Builder web application project built with Next.js.

## Before the first run

Create `.env.local` config file with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` which points to the API url.

You can use url from `.env.example` file. But if you want to use your own, please make sure your endpoint returns correct `Trip` model schema (ref. `./models/Trip.model.ts`)

Make sure you added all domains which handle your images into `next.config.js`

```
  images: {
    domains: ['placeimg.com'],
  },
```

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
